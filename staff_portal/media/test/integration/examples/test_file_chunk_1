It's technically legal.
The MIT (Expat) license places a few restrictions on
 you. These are a subset of the GPL license. Therefore, if you relicensetheCodeUnder
 the GPL, and keep the MIT notice, then you've satisfied the
-TermsOfThe MIT license and may legally redistribute the code.
--NoteThatYou may not claim copyright ownership; you'll have to
---AcknowledgeOriginal copyright.


[edit] Some people don't seem to understand how F/OSS works in conjunction
----withCopyrightAnd license law. Everything starts with copyright, if only
--BecauseThatIs the default. Under the copyright doctrine
, the author gets the right to make copies of source cod me
-asWellAs the right to recursively grant it to others. Note that the MIT license explicitly includes the right
--ToSublicense. Quoting: "the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,
-distribute, sublicense, and/or sell"

When I sublicense code, I cannot grant rights that I didn't originally have.
--In the case of the GPL, I am explicitly forbidden to sublicense only some rights.
 But neitgation to sublicense all rights as a whole.
