So how do you build a similar online shopping system that stores an inventor
-y of products under different categories, allow customers to search through
-- them, and make purchases. Furthermore, how do you handle the expanding load
---on the website and prevent it from crashing down, particularly on busy da
--ys, such as the Black Friday Sale?
Though Amazon is a multifaceted platform that offers an exhaustive range of pro
----ducts and services, for the sake of simplicity, we will only try to unders
---tand and recreate a simpler version of their online retail business. An onl
--ine retail platform or e-commerce application allows users to buy and sell p
-roducts.
Sellers should be able to add, delete and modify products they want to sell.
The website should include a catalog of products.
Buyers can search products by name, keyword or category.
Buyers can add, delete or update items in a cart.
Buyers can purchase items in the cart and make payments.
Buyers can view their previous orders.
Buyers can review and rate purchased products.
