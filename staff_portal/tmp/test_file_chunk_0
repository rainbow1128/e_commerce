With a union, you're only supposed to use one of
 the elements, because they're all stored at the same spot. This makes
--it useful when you want to store something that could be one of
-several types. A struct, on the other hand, has a separate memory
--location for each of its elements and they all can be used at once.
---Why are the two values the same? Because the last 3 bytes of the
----int 3 are all zero, so it's also read as 99. If we put in a larger
--number for x.a, you'll see that this is not always the case
-You can clearly see where the 0x22 overwrote the 0xEF Write your name
 by using array as each element as character.
